I checked out the separate monthly datasets by merging them in data-check.ipynb & thereafter upon inspection, it was found that another file provided to me in the dataset - 'Final.csv' resembled completely with the merged dataset. Hence, after much analysis, I went ahead to answer questions using Final.csv file via Kaggle.
